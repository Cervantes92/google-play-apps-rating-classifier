# Decision Trees and Android Applications

This notebook and accompanying presentation is an exploration of tree-based ensemble modeling. In this project, I explore a dataset currated by [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps) which contains the metadata associated with nearly ten thousand apps available on the google play app store.

## Models

In this project I explore the use of decision trees, random forrests and gradient boosting algorithms to determine their relative efficiency and their effectiveness both as classifiers and regressors. I chose to use the google play store app database due to its variety of data types that may be used as features.
